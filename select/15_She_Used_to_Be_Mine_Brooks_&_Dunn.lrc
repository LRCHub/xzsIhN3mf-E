[00:21.11] She looked so good movin' 'cross the dance floor
[00:28.08] Better than the day she left me
[00:32.65] Arm in arm with somebody new
[00:38.12] Holdin' hands and laughin' like we used to
[00:43.83] I got my best smile on, but it's no disguise
[00:50.91] It don't hide the pain in these eyes
[01:08.91] 
[00:55.07] I did her so wrong, for so long
[01:00.89] Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone
[01:06.89] I did my part, to break her heart
[01:11.90] She walked out on me, and tore my world apart
[01:17.33] She used to be mine
[01:20.83] Oh, she used to be mine
[01:32.33] 
[01:39.38] It's taken every bit of strength that I have
[01:45.65] To keep a hurt look off of my face
[01:50.24] I can't keep from lookin' back over my shoulder
[01:56.80] At the lucky man takin' my place
[02:01.79] Oh, if it weren't for my pride, I'd probably take off runnin'
[02:08.92] Guess what I'm feelin', is what I got comin'
[02:30.92] 
[02:12.89] I did her so wrong, for so long
[02:18.95] Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone
[02:24.63] I did my part, to break her heart
[02:29.81] She walked out on me, and tore my world apart
[02:35.32] She used to be mine
[02:39.50] Oh, she used to be mine
[02:51.00] 
[02:56.78] Oh, I did her so wrong, for so long
[03:02.85] I turned my back on her love, now she's long gone
[03:09.24] I did my part, oh, to break her heart
[03:14.41] She walked out on me, and tore my world apart
[03:20.05] She used to be mine
[03:24.00] Oh, she used to be mine
[03:35.50] 
[03:29.48] Oh, she used to be mine
[03:35.86] She used to be mine
